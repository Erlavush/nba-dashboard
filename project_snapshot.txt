# - .RData : R workspace data
# - .rds / .rda : Saved R objects (often large/binary)

        "Description": "Summarizes key information about statistical\n    objects in tidy tibbles. This makes it easy to report results, create\n    plots and consistently work with large numbers of models at once.\n    Broom provides three verbs that each provide different types of\n    information about a model. tidy() summarizes information about model\n    components such as coefficients of a regression. glance() reports\n    information about an entire model, such as goodness of fit measures\n    like AIC and BIC. augment() adds information about individual\n    observations to a dataset, such as fitted values or influence\n    measures.",

The simplest way to evaluate an expression\n    in parallel is to use `x %<-% { expression }` with `plan(multisession)`.\n    This package implements sequential, multicore, multisession, and\n    cluster futures.  With these, R expressions can be evaluated on the\n    local machine, in parallel a set of local machines, or distributed\n    on a mix of local and remote machines.\n    Extensions to this package implement additional backends for\n    processing futures via compute cluster schedulers, etc.\n    Because of its unified API, there is no need to modify any code in order\n    switch from sequential on the local machine to, say, distributed\n    processing on a remote compute cluster.\n    Another strength of this package is that global variables and functions\n    are automatically identified and exported as needed, making it\n    straightforward to tweak existing code to make use of futures.",

        "Description": "A minimal, unifying API for scripts and packages to report progress updates from anywhere including when using parallel processing.  The package is designed such that the developer can to focus on what progress should be reported on without having to worry about how to present it.  The end user has full control of how, where, and when to render these progress updates, e.g. in the terminal using utils::txtProgressBar(), cli::cli_progress_bar(), in a graphical user interface using utils::winProgressBar(), tcltk::tkProgressBar() or shiny::withProgress(), via the speakers using beepr::beep(), or on a file system via the size of a file. Anyone can add additional, customized, progression handlers. The 'progressr' package uses R's condition framework for signaling progress updated. Because of this, progress can be reported from almost anywhere in R, e.g. from classical for and while loops, from map-reduce API:s like the lapply() family of functions, 'purrr', 'plyr', and 'foreach'. It will also work with parallel processing via the 'future' framework, e.g. future.apply::future_lapply(), furrr::future_map(), and 'foreach' with 'doFuture'. The package is compatible with Shiny applications.",
